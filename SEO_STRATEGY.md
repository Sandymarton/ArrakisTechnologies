## 🚀 How to Rank for "Voice Secretary" & "AI Automations"
Ranking for broad terms like "AI Automations" is extremely difficult immediately. The winning strategy is to **dominate the niches first** (Long-Tail Keywords) and let that authority "trickle up" to the main keywords.

### Phase 1: The "Low Hanging Fruit" (Week 1-2)
*Get your site listed on authoritative directories. These are easy, high-quality backlinks.*

1.  **AI Directories (High Authority):** Submit Arrakis to:
    - [There's An AI For That](https://theresanaiforthat.com/)
    - [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/)
    - [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) (Plan a proper launch here)
    - [Toolify.ai](https://www.toolify.ai/)
2.  **SaaS Directories:**
    - G2, Capterra, Crunchbase.
3.  **Local SEO:**
    - If you have a physical presence or want to target a region, create a **Google My Business** profile.

### Phase 2: Niche Infiltration (The "Sniper" Approach)
*Use your 5 new blog pages to get relevant links. A link from a Legal blog to your "AI for Lawyers" page is worth 10x a generic link.*

-   **Legal Page:** Find "Legal Tech" blogs or newsletters. Offer a guest post: *"How 24/7 Intake Doubles Law Firm Retainers"*.
-   **Restaurant Page:** Contact hospitality magazines or restaurant tech blogs. Topic: *"Solving the Staff Shortage with Voice AI"*.
-   **Real Estate Page:** Connect with Real Estate Coaching blogs.

### Phase 3: "Link Magnets" (Passive Backlinks)
*Create content so good that people link to it for you.*

-   **Data/Case Studies:** You have great ROI stats. Publish a "Case Study: How a UK Dental Clinic Saved £40k with AI". Real data gets cited by journalists.
-   **Free Tools:** We could build a simple, publicly available **"Missed Call Cost Calculator"**. People love linking to free calculators.

### Phase 4: Social Signals
-   Share your new Blog articles on **LinkedIn**.
-   Tag influencers in those specific industries (e.g., tag a Real Estate coach when sharing the Real Estate article).

## 📊 Measuring Success (Google Search Console)
You **must** connect your site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
1.  Go to GSC.
2.  Add Property (`https://arrakistechnologies.com`).
3.  It will ask you to verify ownership.
    -   *Option A:* Add a TXT record to your DNS (Godaddy/Namecheap/etc).
    -   *Option B:* I can add a `<meta>` tag to `index.html` if you give me the code.

**Your Goal:**
Don't obsess over "AI Automations" yet.
Obsess over **"AI Voice Receptionist for Lawyers"**.
Rank #1 for that, and you will start ranking for the broader terms automatically.
