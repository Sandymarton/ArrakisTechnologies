# How to Get Your Google Search Console Code

To let Google track your site, we need a verification code. I can install it for you if you follow these steps:

1.  **Go to Google Search Console:**
    [https://search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)

2.  **Add Your Website:**
    -   Click the dropdown in the top-left corner.
    -   Select **"Add Property"**.
    -   Choose the **"URL Prefix"** option (the one on the right).
    -   Enter `https://arrakistechnologies.com`.
    -   Click **Continue**.

3.  **Get the HTML Tag:**
    -   Google will offer several verification methods.
    -   Scroll down to **"HTML tag"**.
    -   Click it to expand.
    -   **COPY the meta tag code** (it looks like `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="..." />`).

4.  **Send it to me:**
    -   Paste that code into our chat here.
    -   I will add it to your website immediately.

5.  **Verify:**
    -   Once I tell you it's done, go back to that Google page and click **"Verify"**.
    -   You're done! ✅
