## 2. Outreach Templates (The "Sniper" Approach)
*Send these emails to blog owners to get Guest Posts.*

### **Email 1: For Legal Tech Blogs**
**Subject:** Guest Post Idea: Automated Intake for Law Firms?

Hi [Name],

I've been reading [Blog Name] for a while (loved your piece on [Reference a recent article]).

I'm the founder of Arrakis AI, a voice automation tool for law firms. We've seen firms increase retainer agreements by 30% just by answering calls 24/7.

I'd love to write a guest post for your audience titled:
**"The End of Missed Cases: How AI Voice Receptionists are Changing Legal Intake"**

It would cover:
1. The hidden cost of voicemail for attorneys.
2. Ethical considerations of AI in client intake.
3. Real-world data on "speed to lead".

Let me know if this sounds interesting? I can have a draft ready in 48 hours.

Best,
[Your Name]

### **Email 2: For Real Estate Coaches/Blogs**
**Subject:** Speed to Lead: New data for your agents?

Hi [Name],

Big fan of your coaching content.

Quick question: Do you ever talk about "Speed to Lead" automation? We're finding that top agents are using AI usage to qualify leads instantly, rather than playing phone tag.

I'd love to contribute an article: **"Stop Chase, Start Closing: Automating Lead Qualification with Voice AI"**.

No sales pitch, just actionable strategies for agents to reclaim their time.

Thoughts?

Best,
[Your Name]

### **Email 3: For Restaurant Technologies / Food Blogs**
**Subject:** 30% of reservations are lost (The "Busy Signal" Problem)

Hi [Name],

I follow [Blog Name] for the latest on hospitality tech.

I'm working with restaurants that are struggling with the staffing crisis. Front-of-house staff are too busy to answer the phone, and voicemails don't get reservations.

I'd love to write a piece for you: **"The Bistro Effect: How AI is ending the 'We're too busy to answer' problem"**.

It covers:
1.  How voice AI integrates with OpenTable/Resy.
2.  Handling "What's on the menu?" questions automatically.
3.  Recovering lost revenue from missed calls during peak service.

Is this something your readers (restaurant owners) would value?

Best,
[Your Name]
